**Gliomas**
    - gliomas = among deadliest types of cancer, survival rate less than 2 years after diagnosis
    - challenging to diagnose, hard to treat and inherently resistant to conventional therapy
    - patient survival largely influenced by molecular, genetic and clinical factors including tumor volume, tumor grade, age at diagnosis and histologic findings
    - detection and analysis dependent on: identifying appropriate pathological features on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and confirmation by histopathology evaluation of biopsied tissue
    - CAD using ML holds promise in increasing accuracy of tumor diagnosis, early detection, classification and in predicting tumor recurrence and patient survival
    
**Africa-specific**
    - years of research have decreased mortality rates across the Global North, while chances of survival among individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain unchanged and are significantly worse in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) populations
    - unclear if the state-of-the-art methods (for detecting, characterising and classifying gliomas) can be widely implemented in SSA given the extensive use of lower-quality MRI technology which produces poor contrast and resolution
    - also propensity for late presentation of disease at advanced stages as well as the unique characteristic of gliomas in SSA
    - research innovations have not translated to survival improvements in LMICs, particularly African populations
    - death rates from glioma in SSA are among the highest in the world and continue to rise
    - death rates in SSA rose on average by ~25% while they dropped in Global North by 10-30% from 1990 to 2016
    - disparity could be due to several factors including:
    - delayed presentation
    - high incidence of infectious disease comorbidities e.g. HIV
    - sever shortage of healthcare infrastructure
    - lack of skilled expertise in diagnosis and treatment
    - novel use of ML will further widen survival disparities if SSA populations are not included in innovative solutions that collectively benefit all patients
    - ML can close survival disparity gaps by overcoming challenges in low-resourced settings where time consuming manual evaluations are limited to the rare centers in urban areas that can afford highly skilled expert personnel to perform tumor analysis
    - unclear if state-of-the-art ML methods developed using BraTS data can be widely implemented for clinical use in SSA particularly given the extensive use of lower quality MRI technology in the region
    - MRI in SSA typically have poor image contrast and resolution and may require further advanced pre-processing to enhance their resolution before application of ML methods
    

**Most typical errors observed in previous BraTS instances:**
    - extension of ET vessels and choroid plexus
    - under and over segmented areas of SNFH
    - incorrect segmentation of areas of hemorrhage as ET
